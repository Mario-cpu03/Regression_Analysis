### Decision Script

# The decision script is used to
# estimate parameters from each Regression Model formulated
# in the "regressionModel.R" script, in order to evaluate 
# those candidate models and choose the most appropriate one

# AIC/BIC, overall F-Test and p-values from individual t-tests will be 
# the model's selection criteria, adopted while using backward 
# stepwise regression to drop non-significant predictors in each model
