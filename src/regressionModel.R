### Regression Model Script

# The regressionModel script is used to define and hypothesize 
# different regression models to evaluate the relationship 
# between the dependent and independent variables that have been
# identified in the descriptiveAnalysis script.

# A first evaluation of the relationship in terms of correlation 
# between y_VideoQuality and xn_* (where n = 1,..,7) will help us 
# define a number of potential models
